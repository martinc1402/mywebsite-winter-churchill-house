#Website - Churchill House


The brief for this project involved creating a website to showcase the Churchill House building by the renowned architect Robin Boyd. A key aspect was to display text and imagery in a way that would not overwhelm the user. I decided that a conservative colour scheme and a minimalist nav would achieve a design that allowed the content to be displayed without excessive clutter.

I struggled to make the website fully responsive and after reading various articles on CSS Tricks, Mozilla Developer Network and Stack Overflow. It became clear to me that if i had planned this out carefully in a more holistic manner, I may have benefited from a carefully constructed usage of CSS Grid, Flexbox and media queries to tackle various screensizes. I did use all three of these methods, however in more of an 'off the cuff' way and this process would have been much more clean if i planned this from the start.

I was happy with some changes that i made to the hero section on the homepage. After reading some articles it became clear that the hero section is a tradition designed to showcase the website subject matter and i thought that a full page width image of churchill house itself would achieve this goal in a visually appealing manner.
